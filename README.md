### Project Explanation for README

**Faculty Member Management System**

This project is a **web-based application** built with ASP.NET Core MVC that allows administrators to manage faculty members and their associated departments. The system provides functionalities to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on faculty members while maintaining the relationship between faculty members and departments. 

**Key Features:**
- **Faculty Member Management**: Add, update, view, and delete faculty member details such as first name, last name, phone number, and email address.
- **Department Integration**: Associate faculty members with their respective departments using a dropdown selection.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is user-friendly and accessible on multiple devices.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins can manage the faculty list, ensuring secure access.

**Technical Details:**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Provides the framework for building the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Handles database operations and maintains relationships between `FacultyMember` and `Department` models.
- **SQL Database**: Stores faculty and department data.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **C# Language**: Core programming language for backend logic.

This project demonstrates the implementation of relational data handling in a real-world academic scenario and serves as a foundational project for learning ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core.
